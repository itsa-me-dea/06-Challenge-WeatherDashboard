## Description

The goal was to utilize server-side APIs, in this case [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/), to create a functional weather dashboard that can provide daily and five-day forcast of a requested city. This will provide the weather for the user to utilize for future planning.

What did I learn? I definitely learned how to use how to better utilize third-party APIs. 

## Installation

No installation is required. See the following link to access the website: https://itsa-me-dea.github.io/06-Challenge-WeatherDashboard/

## Usage

Search for you desired city in the search bar. This will make a fetch request to the OpenWeather API and call the 5-day weather forcast for your inputted city.

Your search history will be saved under the search history select option, where you can select one of these options to open the 5-day forcast again.
